# Tic-Tac-Toe

## A game of tic-tac-toe, written in Python.

#### The rules:

For this game of Tic-Tac-Toe, whoever selects 'X' goes first.

The person who goes first is decided based on a random dice roll, generated after the two players pick their names. Whoever wins the dice roll can select whether they are 'O' or 'X'. If the two players tie, they will roll the dice again until someone wins and someone can pick an 'O' or 'X' to commence the game.

In order to win the game of Tic-Tac-Toe, a full row of three of the same symbol, a full column of three of the same symbol, or a full diagonal of three of the same symbol must be created. Whoever's symbol there are three of in a row, column, or diagonal wins!

##### personal note:
I had a lot of fun coding this! It's been a while since I've tried to do something from scratch and seeing all the different issues that arose has been illuminating. :)
