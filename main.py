# a game of tic-tac-toe

# Before your interview, write a program that lets two humans play a game of Tic Tac Toe in a terminal.
# The program should let the players take roles to input their moves.
# The program should report the outcome of the game.

# During your interview, you will pair on adding support for a computer player to your game.
# You can start with random moves and make the AI smarter if you have time.


# I saw an implementation with a dictionary that I really liked, so we're gonna start there
